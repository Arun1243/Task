1)   instance variables are may be final                        1) instance variables are default final variables

or non-final.


2)   Variables - final,non-final,static, non-static             2) static and final variables

4)   Abstract class can be provide implementation of interface  4) Interface can't provide the implementations of abstract class

5)   Abstract class can be extended using Keyword "Extends"     5) Interface can be implemented using keyword "implements"

6)   A Java abstract class can have class members               6) Java interface are public by default. 
like private, protected, etc.                      

7)    an abstract class can extend another Java class           7) An interface can extend another Java interface only 
and implement multiple Java interfaces.
