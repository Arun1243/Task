Java Architecture:

        *     There is a process of Compliation and Interpretation.
 
        *      The Source code Converted into Byte code which is done by Java Complier  
          
        *      The Byte Codes are Converted  into Machine Code by the JVM.

        *       The Machine Code is excuted directly by the machine.


                  

                  Source Code   ----------->         Java Complier    --------------------->       Byte Code ----------->  JVM   ---------->   OS.





Components of   Java Architecture:


JVM, JRE,   JDK


JVM:

         *      Java   applications are called WORA ( Write Once Run Any Where)   ability to run a code on any Platform.

          *     JVM   interprets the Byte into Machine Code.


JVM Performs Function:


loads, Verifies and Excute the Code. Provides Runtime Environment.



JVM     Architecture :


        Class Loader   --------->      Method Area, Heap,  Stack,  Native Stack    ----------->       Native interfaces  ---------->   Garbage Collector, JIT Complier 
                                                                       JVM Memory                                                                        |--------> Native Libraries            Excution Engine
